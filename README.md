# Machine Learning Specialization. Washington University

I was curiouos about TuriCreate and Graphlab, with its distributed processing and useful tools. Also, performing the required tasks with pandas, sk-learn and matplotlib/seaborn instead could be a nice chance to reinforce my knowledge with this libraries.

# Graphlab

It is kind of a pandas with sk-learn and interactive visualizations, all in once.

I must say the ML work is way easier with GrapLab and TuriCreate. It has a lot of pre-built tools that make life way easier... And that's the plan, reinforce knowledge performing all required processed the hard way, with pandas, sklearn and matplotlib.
